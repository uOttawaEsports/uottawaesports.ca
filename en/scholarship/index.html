                    <p class="text-center fs-5">The University of Ottawa has secured $50,000 over the next 2 years from
                        the Ontario Esports
                        Scholarship Program. High achieving undergraduate and graduate students at uOttawa looking to
                        pursue a career in esports
                        and video gaming can apply for a $2,500 annual scholarship on the uOttawa scholarships and
                        bursaries portal.
                        <br><br>
                        The announcement of the scholarship fund was a result of tight collaboration between the
                        student-run uOttawa Esports club,
                        and passionate uOttawa faculty members. uOttawa Esports Co-President Zack Goldstein comments,
                        “Providing esports specific
                        scholarships to students shows how far we’ve come from a grassroots community, to an
                        organization that is making waves
                        in campus life. My hope is that these scholarships help uOttawa become a major scholastic
                        esports hub not only in
                        Ontario, but Canada as well.”
                        <br><br>
                        The emergence of the Ontario Esports Scholarship Program highlights the necessity to support
                        students researching or
                        pursuing a career in such a rapidly developing industry. The achievement of successful
                        applicants in the realm of
                        esports will demonstrate the need to further support on campus esports and integrate it into the
                        student experience
                        outside of student run programming
                        <br><br>
                        Students can apply for the scholarship through the scholarship and bursaries portal on uoZone.
                        To be considered, students must:
                        <br>
                        1. be a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident, a person with the protected/refugee status or an
                        international student;
                        <br>
                        2. enrolled as a full-time student in a Ministry-approved video-gaming, game development, game
                        design or a similar program that may lead
                        to a career in video-gaming and/or eSports.;
                        <br>
                        3. demonstrate financial need; and
                        <br>
                        4. demonstrate merit, which can include academic achievement and community service.
                        <br><br>
